Damn good question, buddy.<P>

Some batteries can deliver more powerful currents continuously than others without exploding, 
without wasting as much of that current on generating heat versus delivering more power to the
motor and without needing to be replaced after only a few flights before its capacity and power 
diminishes.<P>

This trait, the unit of measurement for it, is referred to as a battery's C rating. 
That's the gist but I'll offer links to explanations written by much smarter people -- I'm just a rookie.<p>

<i>(this is a rough draft, still revising, maybe you should instead watch this video..)</I><p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wP0MhOcPmQY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><P>


Mathematically, a battery's C rating is its amp hours multiplied by the C rating. That we all agree on. 
For example, a 2800mAh 100C battery ought to yield this safe continuous current at 280 amps. 
While someone flying a VisionAire or an Extra 300Q, for example, may only need a 50A current, the overkill
high C rating is appealing because it implies the battery will deliver much closer to the 
same voltage, thereby not spinning the motor much slower, under heavier full-throttle loads.
This is called voltage sag. A big deal for 3D flyers who will pay double for a battery promising
double the C rating of another. <P>

Purportedly, here's a 2800mAh 3S 30C weighing 200g 
<a href="http://www.valuehobby.com/elite-30c-2800mah-3s-ec3.html" title="product page">from ValueHobby for $23</a>.
And here, purportedly, is a 2800mAh 3S 100C weighing 188g 
<a href="https://www.maxamps.com/lipo-2800-3s-11-1v-phantom-battery-pack" title="product page">from MaxAmps for $70</a>. 
The MaxAmps battery promises the same capacity, less weight, safe continuous delivery of over 3x the current 
and for 3x the price. Draw your own conclusion...<p>

There is no set of standards nor a regulatory body to force or lightly pressure MaxAmps (or ValueHobby)
not to grossly exaggerate the C rating in order to sell more batteries at higher prices. And so the RC
community has learned that these claimed C ratings are absurd and next to meaningless, 
some vendors and brands far more than others.<p>

So to offer those looking to buy batteries who care about C ratings batteries' actual C ratings,
<b><a href="/index#procedure" title="my testing procedure">as diligently as I am able</a></b> I have been testing batteries of various brands and claims
in consistent and controlled manners, for example making sure the packs' temperature when taking 
readings is 22C, cycling multiple times and so forth as I outline here.

      <p> To all you battery vendors tuning in, you're a bunch of dirty dirty
        liars and I aim to expose you! At first you'll wonder if you can sue me. Then
        you'll wonder if I get any traffic. Later you may reload the site and see that I
        published your empty threats and you'll tell yourselves perhaps no one will
        visit this site and you should pretend this isn't a problem. Maybe
        you're right, most don't know what a discharge rating even is 
	and of those who do most don't care; on the
        other hand you are operating in a saturated market on a thin margin where
        something like this site might make a difference. Let's see
        what happens!  </p>
      <p>

	 But to those of you who are vaguely honest, if any of you exist, word
        may spread about you and the data may drum up some business that you deserve, which won't
        be hard as you would be the outliers in a sea of deceit. 
	 This site is intended to be crude and simple as its aim is to present
	data objectively that I collected diligently. You can expect there to be no
        conflicts of interest as I will not monetize this in any way and have the very same
        interests as those visiting my site: wondering which battery to buy,
        wondering who won't screw me.
